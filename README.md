# Open-RSA-Service
Asymmetric RSA encryption service built in python - allows key generation, encryption and decryption

This service was written in python using the flask framework and pythons built-in cryptography library,
the service works by launching a web server which the user can access through their web browser, 
the user is then able to generate an RSA key pair, encrypt messages using their public key, and decrypt messages using their private key.
